# Liceo Militar Web

This is a webpage proposal for "Liceo Militar General Gregorio Araoz de Lamadrid", a military school from TucumÃ¡n, Argentina. ItÂ´s being completely built by me, and contains HTML, CSS (using grid and flexbox) and JS. A fully artwork of Frontend (and futurely of Backend too ğŸ˜‰).

## Design

The design was made in *Adobe Xd*, using icons from icomoon.io. The images and multimedia material are copyright free.

## Code

The code basically contains HTML, advanced CSS and JS. It was made by the "Mobile First" methodology.
